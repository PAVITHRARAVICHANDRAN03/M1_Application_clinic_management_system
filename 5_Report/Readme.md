## Requirements

## Introduction

The Clinic Management System with Source Code is a project that can manage the patient record within the clinic. The system can help you organize the patient details for assigning properly. The purpose of the system is to help and maintain the managing of patient record.

## Research

Nowadays, most of the Businesses  are still using an old system of recording, which is done manually. The stuff/assistant are still experiencing an old tradition of recording, where it consumes more space, time, paper and other problem redundancy to find/store the patient's information.
Nowadays, the current Clinic Management System that are available had not been widely used. This is because the process of task that occurred in hospitals is quite complex compared to other organization.Manual Recording System, even in today's world can still provide an effective and useful way to record and deliver an efficient information system. Employees will have to do it manually and takes time to properly arrange the records.The Clinic record Management System  is designed and developed to guarantee the removal of various problem or to eliminate the problem of redundant that was increase the inefficiencies in data to be retrieve. These keeping of records were caused by the data, under the manual recording system was entered into books and paper files and was later stored in overcrowded storage rooms that may be made the retrieval of records close to impossible due to the manual system.
